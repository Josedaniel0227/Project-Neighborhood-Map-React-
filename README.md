# Neighborhood Map Project
## MIAMI BEACH HOTELS


### Project Overview

This is the last Project of the [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree with Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).
The goal of this app is to develop a single page application featuring a map of a neighborhood. Then, add functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

### Purpose

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of React, use of third-party libraries and APIs and asynchronous programming.

This app provides a interactive map displaying a list of hotels in the city of Miami Beach. Markers Drop according to the list and if click, an infowindow displays unique information about a location. Map displays all location markers by default, and displays the filtered subset of location markers when a filter is applied.

The map is developed by the Google Maps API. The list of Hotels is achieved by a call to the Foursquare API Search endpoint.

A list of all the requirements to complete the project is here: [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1351/view)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## How to run


1. Clone or fork this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/Josedaniel0227/Project-Neighborhood-Map-React-.git
```
2. Download a local copy
3. In your computer's terminal inside project directory, you can run:


## Installing a Dependency

The generated project includes React and ReactDOM as dependencies. It also includes a set of scripts used by Create React App as a development dependency. You may install other dependencies (for example, React Router) with `npm`:

```sh
npm install --save react-router-dom
```

Alternatively you may use `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add react-router-dom
```

This works for any library, not just `react-router-dom`.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


## Working Offline

```sh
npm run build
```
Runs the app in production mode.<br>

cd to the `build` directory and launch a localhost server.

For Python 2.x, the command is:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

For Python 3.x, the command is:

```
-m http.server 8080
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.
